# Project Installation (BE)

Use the next steps to install the project. Please make sure you change all references of <your-user> to the one that applies to you.

1.  Create the following folder structure ```/Users/<youruser>/clients/talos/spartacus-training-project/hybris/bin```

2.  Go to the bin folder and clone the repository with the following command ```git clone https://github.com/talosdigital/spartacus-training.git custom```

    * If you configured your account with Google Login and you don't have a password then you can clone your repository using an UI Tool like **SourceTree**, or create a *AppPassword* in your bitbucket account like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40946844) and use it for your terminal configuration.

3.  Import the repository into source tree and initialize gitflow. At the end you should be in the develop branch

4.  Now is the time to configure some aliases and the Hybris optional config directory (pointing to our local configuration):

    * Download the [.spartacus-training-profile](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qCkuF1ukZY0JtxiGRnGhRIcEWq_ydYFg/view?usp=sharing) and change the paths accordingly.
    * Place you file at the root of the repository (make sure the name starts with a dot)
    * Add your file in your .zshrc (> MacOS Catalina) or .bash_profile (Older MacOS versions). Make sure .zshrc file looks similar to the [sample .zshrc](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OBOCutdWVE4GsfE1gpKgiQaul0R8XYTy/view?usp=sharing). Please change the references to <your-user> to the values that apply to you.
    * Quit the Terminal (`command(⌘) + q`) and re-open it.
    * Run ```echo $HYBRIS_OPT_CONFIG_DIR``` to make sure it was configured properly.

5.  Install ImageMagick in your machine:

    * If you don't have Homebrew, please install it using the command ```/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"```
    * Install ImageMagick using the command ```brew install imagemagick```

6.  Create you local configuration properties by downloading the [sample 20-local.properties](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W2IQrjc2M5RzDah-ZzDoNTfbTzDCVVnS/view?usp=sharing), changing the values that correspond to your local machine and placing the file in ```/Users/<youruser>/clients/talos/spartacus-training-project/hybris/bin/custom/core-customize/project/env/local```

7.  Install hybris code base into your folder structure by running the command
    ```tcproject && ant install -Dhybris.zip.package.src=/path/to/your/CXCOMM201100P_0-70005693.ZIP```

8.  Go to your folder ```/Users/<youruser>/clients/talos/spartacus-training-project/hybris/bin``` and run the following command to give execution permissions to all .sh files
    ```find . -iname "*.sh" -exec chmod a+rx {} \;```

9.  Run the following command to copy the configuration files to the corresponding locations and install all the addons for the project
    ```tcenvconfig && ant installAddons && ant clean all```

10.  Initialize the system by running ```tcsetant && ant initialize``` (The initialization process can take up to 30 minutes)

11.  Start you Sap Commerce instance ```tcsetant && ./hybrisserver.sh```


# Project Installation (Spartacus)

3.  Start your spartacus app by running ```yarn start --ssl```
4.  Open the following URL in your browser ```https://localhost:4200```

# Testing locally with Server Side Rendering (SSR)
1.  As the SSR configuration runs with the production flag, you will need to change locally the property value of occBaseUrl in your ```taloscommercestore/src/environments/environment.prod.ts``` to point to you local backend instance (**Do not commit this change, it is only to test locally**).
2.  Build the project by running ```yarn build:ssr```
3.  Start the project by running ```yarn serve:ssr:local```


# Prettier Configuration for VSCode (Code Format)

2.  Select the Prettier package (the one in ```taloscommercestore/node_modules/prettier```).
3.  Configure the files to be formatted. Use the following values ```{**/*,*}.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,json,scss,html}```
4.  Mark the ***On code reformat*** option as well as the ***On save*** one.
5.  Click Apply and then save your configuration.

# Additional Configurations for WebStorm
1.  Open Webstorm preferences and go to ```Editor & Code Style > TypeScript``` and make sure the value of ```Use path mapping from tsconfig.json``` has the value ```Only in files outside specified paths```.

# SourceTree Configuration

    1.  Make sure you are in the master branch
    2.  Go to ```Repository (menu) > Git flow/ Hg flow > Initialize Repository```
    3.  Initialize gitflow with the default settings. In Case you get the error message ```Device not configured```, run the following command ```git config credential.helper sourcetree```
2.  In order for Husky to work with SourceTree, you must run the following command ```sudo launchctl config user path "/usr/local/bin:$PATH"``` and restart your computer. Make sure ```/usr/local/bin``` is in your ```$PATH```

# Add new SVG Icons
1.  Add SVG icon to the SVG folder ```src/assets/svg```
2.  Execute the script ```yarn generate:sprite```
